# PokerAI

An intelligent poker assistant that uses AI to analyze poker games, track opponent behavior, and provide strategic recommendations in real-time.

## Project Overview

PokerAI is designed to:

- **Read poker table information** from online poker platforms (PokerStars, etc.)
- **Track and analyze opponent behavior** to build player profiles
- **Provide strategic recommendations** using LLM-powered analysis
- **Consider multiple factors** including hand strength, opponent history, and game context

## Core Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Real-time Analysis

- Screen capture and OCR for table reading
- Hand strength evaluation
- Pot odds calculation
- Position analysis

### ðŸ‘¥ Opponent Profiling

- Track betting patterns
- Analyze playing style (tight/loose, aggressive/passive)
- Build hand range databases
- Historical performance tracking

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Decisions

- LLM integration for strategic recommendations
- Multi-factor decision analysis
- Hand range estimation for opponents
- Action recommendations with reasoning
